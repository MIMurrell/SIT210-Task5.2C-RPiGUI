#Created for SIT210 Task 5.2C

### LIBRARIES ###
from tkinter import *
import tkinter.font
import RPi.GPIO as GPIO

#### PIN DEFINITIONS ###
RED_PIN = 11
GREEN_PIN = 13
BLUE_PIN = 15

GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BOARD)
GPIO.setup(RED_PIN, GPIO.OUT)
GPIO.setup(GREEN_PIN, GPIO.OUT)
GPIO.setup(BLUE_PIN, GPIO.OUT)

### GUI DEFINITIONS ###
win = Tk()
win.title=("Three LED Switch")
winFont = tkinter.font.Font(family = "Helvetica", size = 13, weight = "bold")

### EVENT FUNCTIONS ###
#Turns off all three of the LEDs
def lightsOut():
    GPIO.output(RED_PIN, GPIO.LOW)
    GPIO.output(GREEN_PIN, GPIO.LOW)
    GPIO.output(BLUE_PIN, GPIO.LOW)

#Changes the Active LED to the one selected in selLED
def changeLED():
    lightsOut()
    if selLED.get() != 0: #No light is turned on if selLED is equal to 0
        GPIO.output(selLED.get(), GPIO.HIGH)

#Turns off all of the LEDs, cleans up GPIO and closes the window
def close():
    lightsOut()
    GPIO.cleanup()
    win.destroy()

### WIDGETS ###
#The variable used to track which LED should be turned on. 0 (off) by default
selLED = IntVar()
selLED.set(0)

#The radio button that turns off all LEDs when selected.
offRadio = Radiobutton(win, text="Off", variable=selLED, value=0, command=changeLED, width=10, anchor="w", font = winFont)
offRadio.grid(row=0, column=0)

#The radio button that turns on only the red LED when selected
redRadio = Radiobutton(win, text="Red", variable=selLED, value=RED_PIN, command=changeLED, activebackground="red", width=10, anchor="w", font = winFont)
redRadio.grid(row=1, column=0)

#The radio button that turns on only the green LED when selected
greenRadio = Radiobutton(win, text="Green", variable=selLED, value=GREEN_PIN, command=changeLED, activebackground="green", width=10, anchor="w", font = winFont)
greenRadio.grid(row=2, column=0)

#The radio button that turns on only the blue LED when selected
blueRadio = Radiobutton(win, text="Blue", variable=selLED, value=BLUE_PIN, command=changeLED, activebackground="blue", width=10, anchor="w", font = winFont)
blueRadio.grid(row=3, column=0)

#The button that turns off and cleans up the program when clicked.
exitButton = Button(win, text = "Exit", font = winFont, command = close, height = 1, width = 10)
exitButton.grid(row=4, column=0)

#Calls the close function when the window is closed
win.protocol("WM_DELETE_WINDOW", close)

#The main loop of the GUI
win.mainloop()
